A RegexEvaluationView is a very simple widget, that was created when we first started this project. It simply allows entering a regex and a string and shows an alert wether the string is matched by the regex upon pressing a button.

Instance Variables
	regexEntry: text area that contains the regex
	stringEntry: text area that contains the string to be matched
